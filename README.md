Project Title: - correlation_function_analysis

Summary:

Form-factors are important quantities that can be calculated in Lattice QCD to know about the interactions of hadrons with electro-weak currents. They are calculated from the time-dependence of three-point correlation functions. 
When there are multiple form-factors involved the analysis gets a little tricky because the time-dependence of many three-point functions has to be fit. After this, depending on the symmetries, some form-factors involved in different combinations of hadrons and currents in the three-point functions are similar. This linear system has to be solved. To extract the form-factor.
The idea of this project is to develop a generic software layer on top of the existing frameworks that can perform the fits and solve the system of equations to get multiple form-factors from three-point correlation functions in lattice QCD.
